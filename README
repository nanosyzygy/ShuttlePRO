This is a user program for interpreting key, shuttle, and jog events
from a Contour Design ShuttlePRO v2.  It translates these events into
X keystrokes, mouse button presses, or scroll wheel events.  It was
developed and tested on kubuntu 12.10.

ShuttlePRO events can generate sequences of multiple keystrokes,
including the pressing and releasing of modifier keys.  The binding
can be selected based on the title of the window which is focused.

Build instructions:

# apt-get install build-essential libx11-dev libxtst-dev

$ make

Install instructions:

# cp 99-ShuttlePRO.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
# make install

This will install the binary "shuttlepro" and a script "shuttle" in
/usr/local/bin.  The udev .rules file allows global read access to any
ShuttlePRO v2 devices plugged into the system.  The script passes the
name of the shuttle device to the binary, so you can configure it
there if it is different on your system.

Configuration instructions:

Copy the example.shuttlerc file to $HOME/.shuttlerc and edit it
there.  While you are configuring this file, you probably want to run
the "shuttle" script from a terminal to see the program output.  Make
sure /usr/local/bin is in your $PATH.

The program re-reads the .shuttlerc file whenever it notices that the
file has been changed, but it only checks when a shuttle event is sent
with a different window focused from the previous shuttle event.  When
you save a new version of the .shuttlerc file, it is a good idea to
deliver shuttle events to two different windows to insure that the new
copy of your file is loaded.

See the example.shuttlerc file for information about the file.  You
may also want to look at the comment at the top of readconfig.c.
